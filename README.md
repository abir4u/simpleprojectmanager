# simpleprojectmanager
This is a simple POC using React.js where I can add/delete a set of projects stored at the frotend.


To make this project work, the following steps must be followed:

Prerqeuisites:
Have NodeJS and NPM installed in your machine by downloading it from nodejs.org

Steps:
1. Go to your project folder from Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Run the command 'npm install -g create-react-app' (if you have already not done it beforehand)
3. Run the command 'create-react-app xyz' (where 'xyz' could be anything. It is the name of the project you want to put)
4. Use Finder/Windows Explorer to navigate into your local project and open folder 'src'
5. Paste the content of this repository in src
6. Go back to Terminal/Command Prompt and 'cd' into your project folder
7. Run the command 'npm start'
